      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
I will be making a college portfolio on Square Space to showcase various projects and experiences I have has throughout my college career. I will include an about me page, my resume, my contact information, my work done through college, and experiences I have had the opportunity of having. My goal for this project is to not only have a place to display all of my work and experiences that I am proud of, but to show I am capable of designing a website that is different than the original template.
    </p>

<h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>
      My target audience is future employers, for them to get a better understanding of my past work and experiences. I would also like to target current SMAD or design students for them to get inspiration from my past work and gain ideas for theirs.
      </p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <p>
      My timeline for the project is to have the user research and a site map done by February 17th. I would like to have a completed prototype/ draft by February 21th for my peers to give me feedback and have the final, completed portfolio done by the beginning of March. This way I will be able to get feedback on my draft and have time to correct and make changes. Having it completed by March will allow me to send it to potential employers and show on interviews.
      </p>
